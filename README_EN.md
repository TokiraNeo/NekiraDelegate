# NekiraDelegate

## ðŸŸ©

- [ä¸­æ–‡](README.md)

## ðŸ“ƒ Introduction

```
NekiraDelegate is a C++ delegate system that includes both singlecast and multicast delegates.
```

## ðŸš€ Current Progress

- [x] Function Traits
- [x] Type Erasure
- [x] Factory Functions
- [x] Singlecast Delegate
- [x] Multicast Delegate
- [x] Quick Macro Declaration
- [ ] Library Packaging

## ðŸŸ  C++ Standard

```
This library uses C++20 concepts. Ensure your compiler supports at least C++20.
```

## ðŸ”– Namespace

```
The namespace for this library is NekiraDelegate. All methods and types, except macros, are within this namespace.
```

|         Support for Regular Functions          |
| Support for Member Functions (const, volatile) |
|  Support for Functors and Lambda Expressions   |
|         Support for `std::function<>`          |

## ðŸ“‚ File Structure

The file structure is divided into four parts:

- `FunctionTraits/`:
  Implementation of function traits, assists with `static_assert()` for static checks.

- `CallableInterface/CallableInterface.hpp`:
  Type erasure implementation, supports regular functions, member functions (including const, volatile), functors, lambdas, and std::function<>.

- `CallableInterface/CallableFactory.hpp`:
  Provides factory functions for wrapping various callable objects and some helper functions.

- `Delegate/`:
  Delegate implementation, including singlecast delegate (`Delegate`) and multicast delegate (`MulticastDelegate`). Provides quick declaration macros for delegates.

- `Demo/NekiraDelegate.cpp`:
  Demo showcasing the usage of the NekiraDelegate system.
